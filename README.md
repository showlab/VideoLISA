This is repo for NeurlPS 2024 paper: One Token to Seg Them All: Language Instructed Reasoning Segmentation in Videos.

We have released our paper on arXiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19603

We are trying our best to clean and organize the code. It will be available soon. Please stay tuned!

**2024.11.04 Update** We are experiencing an internal review process longer than we expected. If you are interested in this project and plan to use it in your own project, don't hesitate to concat me via email: zechenbai AT u.nus.edu. I'd love to provide any assistance.
