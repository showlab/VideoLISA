## ReasonVOS Benchmark

To effectively evaluate the reasoning segmentation task in videos, we construct a new benchmark, called ReasonVOS.
Note that this dataset is constructed based on existing video object segmentation datasets,
including [BURST](https://github.com/Ali2500/BURST-benchmark) (released under MIT License),
[VIPSeg](https://github.com/VIPSeg-Dataset/VIPSeg-Dataset) (released under `non-commercial research purpose only`),
[MOSE](https://github.com/henghuiding/MOSE-api) (released under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 License),
and [MeViS](https://github.com/henghuiding/MeViS) (released under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 License).

Shout out to these amazing works!!
